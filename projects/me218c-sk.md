# **Super KARLio - *Nautical Electromechanical Device for Mobile Operation (NEDMO)***  

*Super KARLio* is a Nintendo-inspired project designed to control an autonomous aquatic robot, the *0 Ingress Lightweight Uncrewed Scuttlebutt (0ILUS)*, via a custom NES-style controller (*NEDMO*). The NEDMO wirelessly communicates with the 0ILUS using XBee (Zigbee) modules for real-time control of propulsion, refueling, and water-shooting mechanisms. The system integrates embedded software, custom protoboards, analog signal processing, and retro-inspired mechanical design for an immersive, game-like experience.
