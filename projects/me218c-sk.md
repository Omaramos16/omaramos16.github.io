# **Super KARLio - *Nautical Electromechanical Device for Mobile Operation (NEDMO)***  

*Super KARLio* is a Nintendo-inspired embedded system that enables real-time control of an autonomous aquatic robot (*0ILUS*) via a custom-built NES-style controller (*NEDMO*). NEDMO wirelessly communicates with 0ILUS using custom XBee (Zigbee) protocols, handling propulsion, refueling, and water-shooting. The system integrates event-driven firmware, custom electrical design, analog signal processing, and retro-inspired mechanical design for an immersive, game-like experience.

## üö© Key Engineering Challenges & Solutions  

- **Ensuring Seamless Cross-Team Compatibility**  
  - *Challenge:* Every controller needed to control any team's boat via a standardized pairing protocol, requiring robust communication across independently designed systems.  
  - *Solution:* Designed a flexible UART-based pairing system, ensuring universal compatibility while collaborating with other teams to refine communication protocols.  

- **Designing for Frequent Handling & Transport**  
  - *Challenge:* The system needed to be repeatedly transported between test environments, and project requirements mandated that all components remain in separate physical enclosures.  
  - *Solution:* Integrated detachable DB9 connectors with built-in strain relief, ensuring durability and ease of reconfiguration during testing and usage.  


- **Managing Mixed-Voltage Components & Power Stability**  
  - *Challenge:* The system contained both 5V and 3.3V logic-level components, requiring careful integration to prevent signal integrity issues. Additionally, a single power source had to drive motors, LED displays, logic circuits, sensors, and inputs, making noise isolation and voltage stability critical.  
  - *Solution:* Used buffers (74ACT244) for logic-level shifting and designed a regulated power distribution system with decoupling capacitors, twisted-pair routing, and proper grounding techniques to minimize noise and ensure stable operation across all subsystems.
