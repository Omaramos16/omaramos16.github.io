## üìñ **Project Summary**  

This project was part of **CS225A: Experimental Robotics**, where my team developed a **human-in-the-loop robotic batting simulation** using the **SAI2 framework**. The system simulated a Panda robotic arm with a bat attachment, using **real-time physics, collision detection, and trajectory calculations** to hit virtual baseballs.  

The key innovation was enabling *real-world human interaction* with a simulated robot. A user controlled ball launches in real-time using OptiTrack motion tracking and a glove-mounted button, with the simulated Panda arm reacting dynamically to execute a swing.

## üõ†Ô∏è **Key Technologies & Concepts**  

- **Multi-Threading & Concurrency Control:** Mutexes, atomic flags, and signal handlers ensured safe shared-memory access across threads.  
- **OptiTrack Motion Capture:** Used infrared tracking cameras to capture the hand‚Äôs position and release motion in real time.  
- **Redis Communication:** Integrated real-time control messaging between the simulation and external input devices.  
- **URDF Modeling:** Modified the Panda arm‚Äôs URDF to include a bat attachment and collision geometry.  
- **SAI2 Simulation Framework:** Used Sai2Graphics, Sai2Simulation, and Sai2Model to run physics-based interactions.    
- **Ball Trajectory & Strike Zone Detection:** Used gravity physics and impact calculations to determine strike validity.

**Simulation & URDF Modeling**  
- Integrated *ew collision geometry for bat-ball interactions to improve realism.  
- Tuned mass, inertia, and damping properties for realistic ball flight.  

**OptiTrack Motion Capture Integration**  
- Processed hand-tracking data from OptiTrack cameras to determine release velocity.  
- Synchronized hand velocity and release position to accurately launch virtual baseballs.  

**Glove-Based Ball Release Detection**  
- Used **serial communication with Redis** to transmit real-time button presses to the simulator.  
- Custom glove detected ball release events, allowing natural throwing motions to be replicated.  

**Simulation Visualization & Rendering**  
- Managed scene assets, transformations, and dynamic camera adjustments.  
- Implemented strike zone visualization and real-time ball tracking.  

- **Physics-Based Ball Tracking & Strike Detection**  
- Computed gravity-based trajectory intersections to determine if a pitch entered the strike zone.  
- Dynamically adjusted camera view based on whether the ball hit or missed.

## üîç **Breakdown of  Simulation & System Design**  

The batting robot simulation required real-time coordination between multiple components: a human throwing motion, a virtual ball launch, and the robotic bat reacting dynamically. To achieve this, the system had to:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Process real-world inputs from the user in real-time, using an OptiTrack motion capture system and a glove-mounted button to track when and how a ball was thrown.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Simulate physics and robot movement at high speed, ensuring that the Panda robotic arm accurately executed swings while tracking the ball's motion.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Continuously update the visualization and interactions, rendering the simulation in sync with physics calculations and adjusting the camera to focus on key events.

To handle these tasks efficiently, I designed a multi-threaded system with separate execution threads for:

- Simulation updates (handling physics, robot control, and ball dynamics).
- User input processing (reading motion capture data and detecting button presses).
- Visualization rendering (ensuring the scene and camera adjusted dynamically).

Since these components were running in parallel, I implemented mutexes (locks) and atomic flags to prevent race conditions‚Äîensuring that physics updates, ball tracking, and user inputs didn't interfere with each other. This approach guaranteed that the robot always reacted correctly to human actions while keeping the simulation running smoothly in real-time.

- **Ensuring Thread Safety in Multi-Threaded Simulation**  
  - *Challenge:* Multiple threads accessing Redis keys led to **race conditions**.
