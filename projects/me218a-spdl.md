# Smart Portable Electronics Design Locker (SPDL)

The Smart Portable Electronics Design Locker (SPDL) streamlines analog circuit design for mechatronics and signal processing applications. It automates the creation of eight fundamental circuits‚Äîincluding Op-Amp amplifiers and comparator configurations‚Äîby calculating component values, generating schematics, and recommending precise parts based on user-defined parameters. SPDL eliminates complex manual calculations, making circuit design faster and more accessible.
