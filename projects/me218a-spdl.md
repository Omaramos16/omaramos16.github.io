# [Smart Portable Electronics Design Locker (SPDL)](https://me218a-smartportableelectronicsdesignlab.weebly.com/)

The Smart Portable Electronics Design Locker (SPDL) is a smart product designed to simplify analog circuit design for common applications in mechatronics and signal processing. SPDL automates the creation of eight fundamental circuits, including Op-Amp and comparator configurations. Users select their desired circuit type, input basic parameters, and SPDL handles the rest‚Äîcalculating required values, displaying detailed schematics, and guiding the user to the exact components needed. This eliminates the need for complex calculations and time-consuming component sourcing, making circuit design more efficient and accessible.
