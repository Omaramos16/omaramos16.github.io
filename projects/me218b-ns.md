# System for Quick Removal of Litter (SQRL) - *Nuttin' Special*


SQRL is an autonomous mobile robot designed for precision object retrieval in a competitive robotics challenge. It collects and delivers ACORNs (A Cylindrical Object Representing a Nut) using IR beacon detection, line-following, and real-time motion control. A dual-PIC32 microcontroller system, using SPI communication and hierarchical state machines (HSMs) in UML, enables efficient navigation and object manipulation.
