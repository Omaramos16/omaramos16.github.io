## 📖 **Project Description**  

This project implements a **software-based UART (bit-banged)** entirely in assembly on a **PIC10F322**, a microcontroller **without built-in UART hardware**. Using **precise instruction timing and interrupt-driven reception**, the system reliably transmits and receives **ASCII characters at 2400 baud**.  
 
✔ **Bit-banged TX:** Manually generates start, data, and stop bits via software.  
✔ **Interrupt-driven RX:** Detects incoming data via edge interrupts and samples at **1.5 bit-time intervals**.  
✔ **Uses a Numerically Controlled Oscillator (NCO) for baud rate timing.**  
✔ **Receives, processes, and retransmits ASCII serial data in real-time**, demonstrating full-duplex communication handling entirely in software.

## 🛠️ **Key Technologies & Implementation Details**  

- **Microcontroller:** **PIC10F322 (8-bit, 256 bytes RAM, 512 words Flash)**  
- **Programming Language:** **Microchip PIC Assembly (MPASM, Mid-Range 8-bit Architecture)**  
- **Baud Rate:** **2400 baud, 8-N-1 (8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop bit)**  
- **Transmission Method:**  
  - Uses **an NCO (Numerically Controlled Oscillator) to generate the baud clock**.  
  - Each bit is manually written to the TX pin at the correct timing.  
- **Reception Method:**  
  - **Interrupt-on-Change (IOC) detects start bit.**  
  - **Timer2 interrupt samples** the middle of each bit period.  
  - Assembles received bits into a byte and **echoes it back** in uppercase.
