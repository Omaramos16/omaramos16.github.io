## üéµ **Key Features Implemented**  

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Playback Control (Fast-Forward & Rewind)**  
- Implemented an **interface for playback manipulation**, allowing users to **fast-forward and rewind** through songs.  
- Fast-forwarding was achieved by **cutting note durations in half**, making playback occur at **2x speed**.  
- Rewinding was implemented by **decrementing the note counter**, ensuring that notes were retrieved in perfect reverse order.  
- Updated the **song ROM format** to handle different types of rests (normal & rewind), preventing desynchronization in complex arrangements.  

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Chord Support (Multiple Simultaneous Notes)**  
- Extended the music player to **support polyphonic playback**, allowing **three notes to play simultaneously**.  
- Modified the **song reader FSM** to correctly schedule **multiple notes in parallel**, preventing timing mismatches.  
- Combined multiple sine waves into a **single output waveform**, accurately synthesizing chords.  

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Harmonics (Complex Sound Generation)**  
- Implemented **harmonic frequency synthesis**, adding **weighted multiples** of the fundamental frequency to simulate instrument-like timbres.  
- Created **parallel sine-wave generators** for **fundamental, 2nd, and 3rd harmonics**, applying amplitude scaling for proper audio balance.  
- Integrated harmonics processing into the **note player module**, allowing per-note harmonic customization.  

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Adjustable Waveform Display (VGA Visualization)**  
- Developed a **real-time waveform display** to visually represent the generated audio.  
- Implemented **user-controlled scaling**, allowing adjustment of **height (amplitude) and width (time scale)** via FPGA switches.  
- Optimized **display logic** to ensure smooth rendering of the waveform.
