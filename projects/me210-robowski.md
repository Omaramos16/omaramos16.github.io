## 📖 **Project Summary**  

The **Big Robowski** was an autonomous competition robot that competed in a head-to-head game delivering "good" and "bad" press to scoring buckets. The robot had to **navigate, align, and dispense balls with precision** in a 2-minute 10-second match.  

Our strategy focused on:  
✔ *Fast cycle times* – Rapid navigation and scoring.  
✔ *Reliable IR beacon tracking* – Ensuring accurate field positioning.  
✔ *Mecanum wheels* – Enabling omnidirectional movement and realignment.  
✔ *Robust state machine* – Minimizing transition delays and maximizing scoring opportunities.

## 🚩 **Challenges & Solutions**  

- **Reliable IR Beacon Detection:**  
  - *Issue:* Ambient light interference caused false readings.  
  - *Solution:* *High-pass filtering* removed noise; *op-amp gain* optimized detection range.  

- **Accurate Ball Dispensing Without Active Aiming:**  
  - *Issue:* Needed to release balls into static buckets while moving.  
  - *Solution:* Pre-aligned bowling tubes with servo-controlled release ensured consistency.  

- **Homing & Resetting Position Between Cycles:**  
  - *Issue:* Needed precise alignment for repeatable shots.  
  - *Solution:* Limit switches ensured re-alignment before each cycle.  

- **Non-Blocking Ultrasonic Sensing:**  
  - *Issue:* Sampling the sensor too often caused unstable readings and blocking.  
  - *Solution:* Secondary Arduino handled filtering and threshold detection.
