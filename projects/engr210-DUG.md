# **DUG: Giving Service Dogs a Voice**

DUG is a **custom-built assistive technology device** designed to help service dog handlers communicate with the public and prevent distractions to their working companions. The system consists of a Bluetooth speaker and a handheld remote control, allowing users to trigger pre-recorded messages that remind passersby not to interact with their service dog.  

This project was developed through **direct collaboration with a service dog user**, ensuring a user-centered design process. The final prototype was tailored to meet **specific accessibility needs**, including **button selection for limited dexterity** and **flexible attachment options** for mobility devices.

## 👤 **My Role & Key Contributions**  

- **Component Sourcing & Hardware Selection:** Researched and sourced all critical components, including the Raspberry Pi, Power Source, Bluetooth speaker, and accessibility-focused buttons.  
- **User-Driven Design & Testing:** Worked closely with our user to refine the remote control design based on dexterity limitations and ease of use.  
- **Electrical System Assembly:** Soldered and integrated the remote's push-button system onto a perfboard circuit, connected to the Raspberry Pi’s GPIO pins.  
- **Embedded Software & System Integration:** Assisted in Bash scripting to handle button inputs, trigger audio playback, and maintain Bluetooth connectivity.  
- **CAD Refinements:** Contributed to design adjustments for the 3D-printed remote enclosure to ensure proper fitment of internal electronics.  
- **Documentation & Competition Presentation:** Helped compile extensive documentation detailing design evolution, user feedback, and technical decisions.

## 🚩 **Key Challenges & Solutions**  

- **Ensuring Reliable Wireless Playback:**  
  - *Challenge:* Maintaining a stable Bluetooth connection between the Raspberry Pi and speaker.  
  - *Solution:* Implemented a *systemd service* to automatically reconnect on power-up and handle unexpected disconnections.  

- **Accessibility-Optimized User Interface:**  
  - *Challenge:* Designing a controller that is comfortable and easy to operate for users with limited dexterity.  
  - *Solution:* Tested multiple button sizes and tactile features, incorporating user feedback to select an ergonomic, easy-to-press and differentiate button layout.  

- **Physical Durability & Portability:**  
  - *Challenge:* Ensuring the remote is lightweight, robust, and easy to attach to various mobility devices.  
  - *Solution:* 3D-printed the case using PC-ABS for strength and included a carabiner attachment for flexible placement.  

- **Battery Optimization & Power Management:**  
  - *Challenge:* Balancing battery life with portability.  
  - *Solution:* Selected a long-lasting portable battery and ensured efficient power consumption by running a minimalist Linux system on the Raspberry Pi.
