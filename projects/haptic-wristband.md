# **Wrist-Worn Haptic Device for Motion Guidance**  

This project focused on developing a wrist-worn haptic device capable of providing real-time motion guidance through vibrotactile feedback, enabling intuitive, non-visual communication of movement cues. Designed for assistive technology and rehabilitation, the system integrates IMU-driven feedback, wireless control, and miniaturized electronics into a compact wearable device.

## üõ†Ô∏è **Key Technologies & Concepts**  
- **Embedded Systems & Firmware Development**  
  - Implemented Bluetooth Classic communication on an **Arduino Nano 33 IoT**, replacing the default BLE for increased speed.  
  - Initially planned for a large number of motors, but the **Arduino Nano 33 IoT lacked enough PWM outputs**. To solve this, I sourced and implemented an **I2C-based PWM driver board** (PCA9685), which allowed motor control with only two I2C pins while supporting multiple outputs.  
  - After building the physical prototype, we determined that **fewer motors** were needed than originally assumed. This allowed me to **replace the PWM driver with a ULN2803 Darlington array**, simplifying the circuit and enabling direct motor control from the Arduino in the final PCB version.  
  - Integrated **real-time IMU-based feedback** for dynamic haptic responses.  

- **Circuit Design & Power Management**  
  - Designed a power-efficient circuit that allowed all components to operate off a **single LiPo battery**.  
  - Used a **DC-DC step-up converter** to provide stable power to the microcontroller while isolating motor power.  
  - Added **decoupling capacitors** to prevent power fluctuations from interfering with the Arduino during rapid motor actuation.  

- **Custom PCB Design for Miniaturization**  
  - Redesigned the circuit onto a **two-layer PCB in KiCad**, reducing size and improving robustness.  
  - Incorporated a **ULN2803 8-Channel Darlington Driver** for compact, efficient motor control.  
  - Designed the PCB to be modular, making it adaptable for multiple CHARM Lab projects.  

- **Wearable Integration & Mechanical Design**  
  - Designed a **3D-printed housing** for the electronics and motors.  
  - Mounted the system onto a **velcro armband**, allowing motors to be repositioned based on experimental needs.
