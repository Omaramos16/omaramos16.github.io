## 📖 **Project Description**  

This project showcases my work in **ME220: Introduction to Sensors**, a Stanford graduate course where I explored sensor behavior through hands-on experimentation and applied this knowledge to an assistive technology system design.  

The work can be broken into two major components:  

1. **Technical Foundations - Hands-on Sensor Experiments** (Lab 2 & 3)  
   - Built a **step counter** using smartphone accelerometer data and signal processing techniques.  
   - Conducted a **cycling performance analysis**, investigating speed, acceleration, and force using IMU data.  
   - Utilized **MATLAB for signal processing**, including different filtering techniques.  

2. **Final Project - Designing an Assistive Technology System**  
   - Designed a **wearable device for service dog communication** leveraging sensor-based interaction.  
   - Conducted **sensor sourcing, feasibility analysis, and patent research** to propose a viable system.  
   - Built upon my work in the **DUG Project** (<a href="engr210-DUG.html" target="_blank">detailed here</a>).
