## 🏆 About Me  

I love building **embedded systems and robotics that seamlessly integrate hardware and software** to solve real-world challenges. My focus is on designing **robust, high-performance systems** for automation, robotics, and intelligent devices.  

Beyond engineering, I’m passionate about **mentorship and leadership in STEM**. I teach AI/ML to high school students at [Inspirit AI](https://www.inspiritai.com/){:target="_blank"} and provide college and high school tutoring in engineering and mathematics through [Tutorfly](https://www.tutorfly.com/u/oramosescoto1/){:target="_blank"}, where I’ve completed hundreds of hours of instruction with a 5-star rating.  

At Stanford, I held **leadership and mentorship roles**, organizing hands-on workshops, fostering technical communities, and supporting first-generation students in STEM.  

Outside of engineering, I enjoy **designing & building things**, reading, playing guitar, hiking, and soccer.
